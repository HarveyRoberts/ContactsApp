## A small contacts app

A small project for me to learn how to use React Native Navigation.

### How To install

- run "npm install"
- remove the ContactsApp/node_modules/react-native/local-cli/core/__fixtures__/files/package.json file
- run "npm run android" 
(I haven't made it work on iOS yet because I have install 3rd party packages manually and haven't got a Mac ^^)
